# Game-Of-Life
The Game of Life is a mathematical game devised in 1970 by John Conway. It is the most famous cellular automaton, a simulation game taking no interaction from the player (Conway called it a zero-player game) consisting in a grid of "cells" evolving over time between different states according to a specific set of rules and constituting many unique multicellular patterns. Every such set of rules designates a specific cellular automaton.

Initially a mathematical curiosity, cellular automata gained popularity for their display of complex and seemingly organical behavior, with cell patterns that no longer evolve, others that repeat, and others that displace across the grid. Macroscopically, observing the continuous evolution of a grid evokes the (accelerated) growth of microorganisms cultures, hence the name.

The fact that the complex interactions between cells arise directly from a seemingly simple ruleset has been source of study and reflexion, and the principle was successfully applied to entirely different fields, such as finance, or fluid dynamics.

The systematical nature of the game makes it an excellent development exercise--this very project is just one example of the countless Life implementations existing either online or on hacker kids' laptops.

A striking property of some cellular automata, including Conway's, is their Turing-completeness, which means that they can emulate a universal computation machine, and in theory perform any mathematical computation.
